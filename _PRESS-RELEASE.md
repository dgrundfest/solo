There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

Rank Vote

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

Zero overhead ranked preference voting

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

A quick and easy way to conduct a ranked preference vote among a group of people. The admin navigates to a landing page and creates a ballot and adds voters by email address. Each voter is emailed a ballot and ranks her options according to personal preference. Once all ballots are submited, results are calculated and displayed to all voters.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

It's hard for groups of people in a large meeting to quickly express their preference and come to a choice that balances everyone's preferences. Picking a restaraunt or movie with a large group of friends or deciding between interview canidates at an all hands meeting. 

## Solution ##

Rank Vote lowers the overhead to doing a formal poll. It quickly an anymously get's the pulse of the group and makes sure everyone's preferences are equally waited in coming to a decision.

## Quote from You ##



## How to Get Started ##

Simply navigate to rankvote.me

## Customer Quote ##

Before rank vote we used a lot of informal methods for solicitng group input, but the loudest person tended to always win out. Now we can take everyone's preferences into consideration.

## Closing and Call to Action ##

Next time you're trying to pick between several restaraunts or movies with your friend. Try rank vote.
